# Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)

Not a protocol, but a graphics (and simple animation) file format.

Member of the [MediaTypesFamily](/MediaTypesFamily).

This format was once invented by Compuserve.

It's good to use for diagrams, icons and alike (with hard edges and only a few colors), but should be avoided for photos and such.

Obsoleted by the [PNG](/PNG) graphics file format, but still widely used.
