# Google Summer of Code 2023

Each year Google brings students and beginner contributors and open source projects together in the [Google Summer of Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_summer_of_code). This page tracks Wireshark's participation in GSoC 2023.

[[_TOC_]]

# Guidelines

The ideas below have been contributed by Wireshark's community of developers and users. Some of them are "what ifs". Some are based on very specific and immediate needs. Either way, if you are a student you should contact the submitter/mentor or the wireshark-dev mailing list for background information or clarification before submitting your proposal. More information about wireshark-dev and complete list archives can be found on [the mailing lists page](https://www.wireshark.org/lists/).

If you are adding an idea below, please be as clear and provide as much information as possible. GSoC 2023 allows short (~175 hours) and long (~350 hours) projects. Projects that can be completed within in about 12 weeks are preferred.

## Extcap interface improvements

**Summary.** Wireshark extcap interface allows easy integration of various capture sources. While the extcap interface is generally working fine, there are some outstanding bugs that limit its usefulness. The project idea is to fix multiple extcap related bugs/feature requests, e.g. [graceful shutdown on Windows](https://www.wireshark.org/lists/wireshark-dev/202208/msg00060.html), [Wireshark freezes until extcap opens control pipes](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/18501), [properly indicate capture source](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/13353), [bookmark extcap options as new "interface"](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/14224), [reduce number of configuration calls to extcap binary](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/15779), [implement grouping in selector options](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/15766).

**Expected Result.** Improved extcap interface support, lower amount of open extcap bugs.

**Mentor(s).** Tomasz Moń

**Prerequisites.** C, C++, Qt

**Area(s) of Wireshark.** extcap, UI

## USB Audio/Video stream export

**Summary.** Wireshark features RTP stream analysis and filtering. It would be nice to have similar functionality for USB Audio and/or USB Video class devices. USB Audio devices describe the supported audio formats in class-specific descriptors. Information from descriptors alongside with control requests can be used to determine the format used in isochronous transfers (e.g. 16-bit PCM).

**Expected Result.** Ability to playback captured USB Audio streams.

**Mentor(s).** Tomasz Moń

**Prerequisites.** C, C++, Qt

**Area(s) of Wireshark.** libwireshark (dissector), UI
