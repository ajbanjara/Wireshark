# X11

X11 is version 11 of the [X Window System protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System_core_protocol).

## History

X11 has been the protocol version since September 1987.

## Protocol dependencies

  - [TCP](/TCP): X11 uses [TCP](/TCP) as its transport protocol. The well known TCP ports for X11 are 6000-6063: typically the port number used is 6000 plus the server/display number. Wireshark will only automatically dissect traffic as X11 on ports 6000-6002. Beyond that you'll need to use Decode-As.

## Example traffic

## Wireshark

The X11 dissector is quite functional. A lot of the dissector is automatically generated from the mesa and xcbproto sources which means that protocol extensions are automatically supported as they are added to the protocol.

## Preference Settings

The X11 dissector's sole preference is whether to reassemble TCP segments.

## Example capture file

There are a number of X11 sample captures on the [SampleCaptures page](/SampleCaptures#x11).

## Display Filter

A complete list of X11 display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/x/x11.html)

Show only the X11 based traffic:

``` 
 x11
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter X11 protocols while capturing. However, if you know the [TCP](/TCP) port used (see above), you can filter on that one.
