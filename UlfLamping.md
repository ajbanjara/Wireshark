# Ulf Lamping

Hi\!

I work/develop in the networking business since 1995.

I'm involved in the [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org) project (as time permits) and focused on the GUI development ([GTK+](http://www.gtk.org)) and program documentation. However, sometimes I also work on selected dissectors.

-----

As more people sending me individual mails about Wireshark development:

**Don't send me individual mails about Wireshark development, send it to the [developer mailing list](http://www.wireshark.org/mailman/listinfo) instead, as that's what it's for\!**

Yes, I frequently read the developer mailing list and will respond if I have something to add, this is usually true for all the other Wireshark developers as well.

Sending it to an individual developer might result in:

  - getting rude criticism, as you just shouldn't do so (unless for a good reason)
  - don't get other developers attention / problem solution
  - your mail get stuck in the personal spam filter
  - producing additional work by forwarding it to the mailing list in the end
  - ...

If you still think you should contact me directly:
