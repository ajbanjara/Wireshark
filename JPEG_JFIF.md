# Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) - JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF)

JPEG/JFIF is not a protocol, but:

  - JPEG is a lossy compression algorithm frequently used for photographic data.
  - JFIF is a file format used to contain a JPEG photo.

JPEG / JFIF is good to use for photos, but should be avoided for diagrams, icons and alike (with hard edges and only a few colors).
