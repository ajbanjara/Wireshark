# Microsoft Windows Browser Protocol (Browser)

XXX - add a brief Browser description here

## History

XXX - add a brief description of Browser history

## Protocol dependencies

  - [SMB](/SMB): Typically, Browser uses [SMB](/SMB) as its transport protocol.

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example traffic here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The Browser dissector is (fully functional, partially functional, not existing, ... whatever the current state is). Also add info of additional Wireshark features where appropriate, like special statistics of this protocol.

## Preference Settings

There are no Browser specific preference settings.

## Example capture file

XXX - Add a simple example capture file to the [SampleCaptures](/SampleCaptures) page and link from here. Keep it short, it's also a good idea to gzip it to make it even smaller, as Wireshark can open gzipped files automatically.

Show only the Browser based traffic:
