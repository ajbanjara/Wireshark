# SINEC H1 (H1)

The SINEC H1 protocol is a simple protocol to transfer PLC (programmable logic controller) data between Siemens SIMATIC S5 devices.

## History

XXX - add a brief description of H1 history

## Protocol dependencies

  - [COTP](/COTP): Typically, H1 uses [COTP](/COTP) as its transport protocol. See the [IsoProtocolFamily](/IsoProtocolFamily) for details.

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example traffic here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The H1 dissector is fully functional.

## Preference Settings

There are no preference settings affecting how H1 is dissected.

## Example capture file

XXX - Add a simple example capture file to the [SampleCaptures](/SampleCaptures) page and link from here (see below). Keep this file short, it's also a good idea to gzip it to make it even smaller, as Wireshark can open gzipped files automatically.

## Display Filter

A complete list of H1 display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/h/h1.html)

Show only the H1 based traffic:

``` 
 h1 
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter H1 protocols while capturing.
