# Signaling Compression (SIGCOMP)

Signaling Compression (Sig`  `Comp), a solution for compressing messages generated by application protocols such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (RFC 3261) and the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) (RFC 2326).

## History

## Protocol dependencies

Typically, Sig`  `Comp uses the same transport protocol as the protocol being compressed.

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example decoded traffic for this protocol here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The SIGCOMP dissector is fully functional, and can display the uploded UDVM code and decompress messages if the messages containing the UDVM code is seen. The following libraries are included:

  - [SIP](/SIP)/[SDP](/SDP) (1.0 and later)

  - PIDF and extensions (1.1.3 and later)

Reassembly of segmented TCP packages is implemented.

## Preference Settings

The level of detail of UDVM execution can be set, as well as [UDP](/UDP)/[TCP](/TCP) ports used.

## Example capture file

## Display Filter

A complete list of Sig`  `Comp display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/s/sigcomp.html)

Show only the Sig`  `Comp based traffic:

``` 
 sigcomp 
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter Sig`  `Comp traffic while capturing. However, if you know the port used (see above), you can filter on that one.

Capture only the Sig`  `Comp traffic over the default SIP UDP port (5060):

``` 
 udp port 5060 
```
