XXX - add a brief description of MMS history

## Protocol dependencies

  - See the [IsoProtocolFamily](/IsoProtocolFamily) for protocol dependencies

The mms dissector is created using the [Asn2wrs](/Asn2wrs) compiler.

## Preference Settings

## Example capture file

XXX - Add a simple example capture file to the [SampleCaptures](/SampleCaptures) page and link from here (see below). Keep this file short, it's also a good idea to gzip it to make it even smaller, as Wireshark can open gzipped files automatically.
