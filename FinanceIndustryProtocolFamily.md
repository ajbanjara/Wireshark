# Finance Industry Protocol Family

The finance industry uses a large number of protocols for interaction between trading applications. The most common are so-called *order entry* protocols (used to submit orders to an exchange or other trading venue) and *market data* protocols (used by trading venues to publish information about orders and trades).

This page serves to index information about financial industry protocols for easier navigation.
