# Unicast

Any network packet sent to one destination is *unicast*. Unicast Ethernet, and other 802.x, addresses have their high-order bit set to zero (that is, their first octet is even). All IPv4 addresses are unicast by default, except the ones designated as [Multicast](/Multicast) (224/4) or [Broadcast](/Broadcast) (255.255.255.255/32).
