# The Open Group

To quote the ["About The Open Group" page](http://www.opengroup.org/overview/) on ["The Open Group" web site](http://www.opengroup.org/): "The Open Group is a vendor- and technology-neutral consortium, whose vision of Boundaryless Information Flowâ„¢ will enable access to integrated information within and between enterprises based on open standards and global interoperability."

For example, they release the DCE-related things (e.g. the [DCE/RPC](/DCE/RPC) specs) and probably more.
