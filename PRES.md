## History

This protocol is part of the OSI stack.

## Protocol dependencies

  - See [IsoProtocolFamily](/IsoProtocolFamily) for protocol dependencies

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example traffic here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

## Preference Settings

(XXX add links to preference settings affecting how PRES is dissected).

## Example capture file

XXX - Add a simple example capture file to the [SampleCaptures](/SampleCaptures) page and link from here (see below). Keep this file short, it's also a good idea to gzip it to make it even smaller, as Wireshark can open gzipped files automatically.
