# IEEE

The [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/) is the *Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers*.

They release various [technical standards](http://standards.ieee.org/), including [the IEEE 802.x network protocol standards for LANs and MANs](http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/index.html) e.g. [Ethernet](/Ethernet), [TokenRing](/TokenRing), [WLAN](/WLAN), ...

## General

The IEEE has formally defined many of the protocols one is likely to see on networks today. Wireshark has dissectors for many of these protocols including:

  - IEEE 802.3 - [Ethernet](/Ethernet)

  - IEEE 802.5 - [TokenRing](/TokenRing)

  - IEEE 802.11 - [Wi-Fi](/Wi-Fi)

  - IEEE 802.1Q - [VLAN](/VLAN)

  - IEEE 802.2 - [LLC](/LLC)

  - IEEE 802.3ad-2000 - [LinkAggregationControlProtocol](/LinkAggregationControlProtocol) (lacp)

  - IEEE 802.1AB - [LinkLayerDiscoveryProtocol](/LinkLayerDiscoveryProtocol) (lldp)

XXX - Need to update this list to include references to all IEEE based protcols supported by Wireshark.

XXX - Should the list be sorted alphabetically by IEEE spec number?
