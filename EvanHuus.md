Hi there, I've been tangentially involved with libpcap/tcpdump/wireshark since I took a summer internship at a networking firm in 2009. I started regularly contributing patches to Wireshark in early 2012, and earned commit access in July of that year. My day job is as a developer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/).

In the last few years I've been less of an active contributor (it's no longer directly related to my job, and real life seems to keep getting in the way) but I'm still around and willing to answer questions or help out where needed.

My most significant contribution to Wireshark is the "wmem" memory manager, and its block allocation algorithm (available as stand-alone C code [on GitHub](https://github.com/eapache/wof_alloc)). I've also written [a paper](https://eapache.github.io/assets/Huus2013_Wireshark_HCI.pdf) applying human-computer interaction theories to Wireshark.
