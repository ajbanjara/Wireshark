Hi there, I've been tangentially involved with libpcap/tcpdump/wireshark since I took a summer internship at a networking firm in 2009. I started regularly contributing patches to Wireshark in early 2012, and earned commit access in July of that year.

I'm no longer an active contributor (it's no longer at all related to my job, and real life seems to keep getting in the way) but I'm probably still around and willing to answer questions at times.

My most significant contribution to Wireshark was the "wmem" memory manager, and its block allocation algorithm (available as stand-alone C code [on GitHub](https://github.com/eapache/wof_alloc)). I've also written [a paper](https://eapache.github.io/assets/Huus2013_Wireshark_HCI.pdf) applying human-computer interaction theories to Wireshark.
