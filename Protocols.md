# Protocols

We could move the content of current [ProtocolReference](/ProtocolReference) page here, if we decide to rename all the protocols pages to something like:

Protocols/\<abbrev name\>

as we have to rename all protocols pages to be able to link from the Wireshark GUI automatically to the Wiki pages.
