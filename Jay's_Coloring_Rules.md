This is a [link to Wireshark entries on my blog](http://blog.tp.org/cgi-bin/mt-search.cgi?blog_id=3&tag=wireshark&limit=20). Included are various coloring rules updates and font/icon size fixes for MacOSX/Linux.

This is a general use set of Coloring Rules. I believe the colors are a little easier to view than some of the other sets here. I have updated these to be compatable with 0.10.13 as everything was being marked as red before.
