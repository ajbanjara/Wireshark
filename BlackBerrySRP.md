The [BlackBerry](/BlackBerry) Server Routing Protocol (SRP) is a proprietary protocol used by [BlackBerry](/BlackBerry) smartphones, and the [BlackBerry](/BlackBerry) Enterprise Server to communicate with [BlackBerry](/BlackBerry) Routers, and the wider [BlackBerry](/BlackBerry) Infrastructure for electronic mail delivery, SMS-style messaging ("PIN" messaging), calendar synchronisation, and handset security policy/connectivity settings delivery, among other things.

It typically operates on TCP ports 3101 ([BlackBerry](/BlackBerry) Router), and 4101 ([BlackBerry](/BlackBerry) Desktop Client) - neither of which have been registered officially with IANA for this purpose.

Unfortunately, RIM/BlackBerry have not provided full protocol documentation for SRP; although a rough glimpse at its structure, and (inaccurate) payload type IDs have been [published](http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06-fx.pdf) as a result of reverse-engineering; and a work-in-progress dissector is being developed as part of [Bug \#8225](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8225).
