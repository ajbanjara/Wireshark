# Google Summer of Code 2014

Each year Google brings students and open source projects together in the [Google Summer of Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_summer_of_code). This page tracks Wireshark's participation in GSoC 2014.

[[_TOC_]]

# Guidelines

The ideas below have been contributed by Wireshark's community of developers and users. Some of them are "what ifs". Some are based on very specific and immediate needs. Either way, if you are a student you should contact the submitter/mentor or the wireshark-dev mailing list for background information or clarification before submitting your proposal. More information about wireshark-dev and complete list archives can be found on [the mailing lists page](http://www.wireshark.org/lists/).

If you are adding an idea below, please be as clear and provide as much information as possible. Projects that can be completed in about 12 weeks are preferred.

## Status

We're collecting proposals for projects. See "Ideas" below.

## Add/enhance a dissector

**Summary.** Wireshark currently has a lot of dissector, no all network protocol are supported. The idea is to add a new protocol (e.g., SPDY, ForCES...) or to enhance an existing protocol dissector (e.g., QUIC, 802.11 (Wireless) ...). It is possible to propose a new protocol to support.

**Expected Result.** A new dissector or enhance an existing dissector for Wireshark.

**Mentor(s).** Alexis La Goutte

**Prerequisites.** Intermediate C, Network, RFC

**Area(s) of Wireshark.** libwireshark (dissector)

## Wireshark Qt

**Summary.** Wireshark currently uses the GTK toolkit. An initial port to Qt (aka Wireshark Qt) has begun but there is still lots of work to do. There are also many opportunities to take Wireshark's user interface to the next level. If you have an idea for a better way to implement one of Wireshark's current features or for a great new feature, this is the place to propose it. It is already a part of selected project Wireshark GSoC'13 (Add Follow and Summary window...)

**Expected Result.** A new UI for Wireshark.

**Mentor(s).** Alexis La Goutte

**Prerequisites.** Intermediate C/C++, Qt API, UX

**Area(s) of Wireshark.** UI

-----

## WiX Installer

**Summary.** Wireshark currently uses the NSIS toolkit for the Windows Installer. The idea is use Wix toolkit ( <http://wixtoolset.org/> ) for the Windows Installer, as it will allow us to have a MSI package and enhance the installer experience. Support should be included for both Autotools and CMake.

**Expected Result.** A new Installer for Wireshark.

**Mentor(s).** Alexis La Goutte

**Prerequisites.** Intermediate XML, Windows...

**Area(s) of Wireshark.** Installer
