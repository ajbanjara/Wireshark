## Olivier Biot

I have been using Ethereal(r)/Wireshark since 2000, where I was working on the [WAP](/WAP) technology which provides wireless Internet-like services to small devices like cellular telephones. I had the opportunity to participate in [WAP](/WAP) standardization, and then mainly follow-up of the on-going [WAP](/WAP) standardization work. This was also the main focus of my work on Ethereal(r)/Wireshark until 2004.
