# A tap that displays sorted resolved data in a GUI menu

This tap was originally written for Thomas Baudelet to help with [Issue 16419 - Can't copy "Statistics > Resolved Addresses" as text or save them to a file](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/16419).

**Installation** - place in plugins directory - see [Lua Support in Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/wsluarm.html)
