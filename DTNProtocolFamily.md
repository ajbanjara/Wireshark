# Delay-Tolerant Networking Protocol Family

DTN protocols are used in environments where end-to-end connectivity is not present, individual links are intermittent, or link delays are not consistent.

## History

The DTN architecture is documented in [RFC 4838](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4838) and provides the basis for the Bundle Protocol and its supporting convergence layers.

## Protocols

 - [BP](BP): The Bundle Protocol
 - [TCPCL](TCPCL): The [TCP](TCP) Convergence Layer.
 - [LTPCL](LTP): The LTP Convergence Layer.
