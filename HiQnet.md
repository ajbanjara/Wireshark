# HiQnet

HiQnet is a protocol developed by Harman Pro for pro-audio devices communication and operation.

## History

HiQnet was developed by the Harman Pro Group System Development & Integration Group (SDIG) during 2004, and announced in January 2005.

IANA declared in february 2004 by Bruce Vander Werf.

## Protocol dependencies

HiQnet was designed to be transport independant. As such, it can run on [USB](/USB), serial RS232 and RS485.

For Ethernet, HiQnet uses both [UDP](/UDP) and [TCP](/TCP) as its transport protocol.

The well known port for HiQnet traffic is 3804.

It is IANAÂ registered under iqnet-port service name.

## Example traffic

## Wireshark

The HiQnet dissector is mostly functionnal for Ethernet and is available for testing since the 1.99.2 development release.

## Preference Settings

None for now.

## Example capture files

  - [hiqnet\_netsetter-soundcraft\_session.pcapng.gz](uploads/__moin_import__/attachments/HiQnet/hiqnet_netsetter-soundcraft_session.pcapng.gz "Upload new attachment \"hiqnet_netsetter-soundcraft_session.pcapng.gz\"") A session between Harman [NetSetter](/NetSetter) desktop application and a Soundcraft Si Compact 16 digital mixing console reading and writing very basic informations.

  - [hiqnet\_visiremote-soundcraft\_session.pcapng.gz](uploads/__moin_import__/attachments/HiQnet/hiqnet_visiremote-soundcraft_session.pcapng.gz "Upload new attachment \"hiqnet_visiremote-soundcraft_session.pcapng.gz\"") A session between Soundcraft's [ViSiRemote](/ViSiRemote) iPad application and a Soundcraft Si Compact 16 digital mixing console playing around with different values. The VU-meters stream is not part of this capture because it uses another protocol (UDP on port 3333).

## Display Filter

A complete list of HiQnet display filter fields will be available in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/h/hiqnet.html) as soon as a stable version is released.

Show only the HiQnet based traffic:

``` 
 hiqnet 
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter HiQnet protocols while capturing. However, if you know the [UDP](/UDP) and [TCP](/TCP) port used (see above), you can filter on that one.

Capture only the HiQnet traffic over the default port (3804):

``` 
 tcp port 3804 || udp port 3804 
```
