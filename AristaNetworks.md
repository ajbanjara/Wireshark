[Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com) is a leading provider of Data Center switches.

[Arista switches](https://www.arista.com/en/products) have advanced features for monitoring traffic in high-density and ultra-high performance data centers running at 10Gbps to 100Gbps of link-speed and terabits of aggregate capacity. [Simplify Tap Aggregation with Arista DANZ](http://www.arista.com/en/products/eos/danz) (Data ANalyZer) describes Wireshark compatible packet capture and aggregation features in Arista switches for port mirroring and TAP aggregation.

The [TAP Aggregation with DANZ](https://go.arista.com/l/12022/2013-08-05/d12s3/12022/93562/TAP_Aggregation_Product_Brief.pdf) Product Brief describes features including packet capture & port mirroring, traffic conditioning, and timestamping and outlines how advanced packet capture and Arista EOS features are implemented in the Arista switching product line.

[Tech Tips](https://eos.arista.com/category/top/dev-blog/) are available describing use of advanced mirroring and timestamping with Wireshark:

  - [Introduction to Port Mirroring](https://eos.arista.com/introduction-to-port-mirroring/) describes fundamentals of how port mirroring (an advanced form of SPAN-type functionality) provides programmable access to data, and gives examples of how to set port mirroring up.

  - [Timestamping on the 7150 Series](https://eos.arista.com/timestamping-on-the-7150-series/) provides a technical description of precision timestamping capabilities of Arista switches and how this can be used to gain insights into critical issues occurring in high-speed networks.

  - [Decoding UTC from the timestamps on 7150 Series](https://eos.arista.com/decoding-utc-from-the-timestamps-on-7150-series/) provides sample code and configurations to correlate Arista nanosecond precision timestamps with UTC time in Wireshark.

  - [Displaying Hardware Timestamps in Wireshark](https://eos.arista.com/displaying-hardware-timestamps-in-wireshark/) provides instructions on configuring and operating Wireshark to capture and decode Arista per-packet timestamps originating from Arista equipment (revised).
