Name : Sebastien Tandel

Development Interest : none (or all?) but ... I like nevertheless

  - hacking somehow in wireshark with the only real editor, vi :-D,

  - hunt warnings (I do not really like this one but I hate far more warnings),

  - dreaming how wireshark could be if I had time (like probably several others here :smiley: )

Location : I'm a Belgian lost since a few months in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Hoping (dreaming? :smiley: ) being in Madrid in a year or two.
