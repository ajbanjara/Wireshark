## TcpDump

A different tool similar to TShark. TcpDump is standard and distributed with many many Un\*x-like operating systems (except the one coming with [the tool you will find by googling for "The Interface From Hell"](/nettl))

TcpDump lives at [www.tcpdump.org](http://www.tcpdump.org)

TcpDump is also the place where [LibPcap](/LibPcap) lives; [LibPcap](/LibPcap) is the standard API and [CaptureFile](/CaptureFile) format used by Wireshark and TShark as well as many many other tools.

If you do a lot of network capturing it is well worth the effort to learn all the command line switches to TcpDump for the same reason learning VI is useful. This tool will be there for almost all Un\*xen you will find, TShark might not.

TcpDump has been ported to Windows; the port is called [WinDump](/WinDump), and it lives at [www.winpcap.org/windump](http://www.winpcap.org/windump/). The developers of [WinDump](/WinDump) are also the developers of [WinPcap](/WinPcap), which is a port of [LibPcap](/LibPcap) to Windows; [WinPcap](/WinPcap) lives at [www.winpcap.org](http://www.winpcap.org/).

Following are packet capture utilities for some commercial Unix versions:

  - Solaris: [snoop](/snoop)

  - HP-UX: [nettl](/nettl)
