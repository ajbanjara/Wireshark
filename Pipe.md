# SMB Pipe Protocol (Pipe)

XXX - add a brief Pipe description here

## History

XXX - add a brief description of Pipe history

## Protocol dependencies

  - [SMB](/SMB): Typically, Pipe uses [SMB](/SMB) as its transport protocol.

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example traffic here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The Pipe dissector is (fully functional, partially functional, not existing, ... whatever the current state is). Also add info of additional Wireshark features where appropriate, like special statistics of this protocol.

## Preference Settings

(XXX add links to preference settings affecting how Pipe is dissected).

## Example capture file

XXX - Add a simple example capture file to the [SampleCaptures](/SampleCaptures) page and link from here. Keep it short, it's also a good idea to gzip it to make it even smaller, as Wireshark can open gzipped files automatically.

## Display Filter

A complete list of Pipe display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/p/pipe.html)

Show only the Pipe based traffic:

``` 
 pipe 
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter Pipe protocols while capturing.

## External links

  - add link to Pipe specification and where to find additional info on the web about Pipe
