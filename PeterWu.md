Wireshark contributor since October 2013, core developer since February 2015. Highly recommended activity during your studies, it is fun and you will learn a lot. :smiley:

Started working on the SSL/TLS dissector since it could not decrypt a TLS capture. Besides the SSL/TLS dissector, I am fixing random issues and hunting memory issues with [ASAN](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer). I implemented TLS 1.3, [WireGuard](/WireGuard), and QUIC decryption. HTTP/3 support is work in progress.
