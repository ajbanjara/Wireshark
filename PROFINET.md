# PROFINET protocol family

PROFINET is a set of fieldbus protocols which were introduced several years ago and are developed by the PROFIBUS Nutzerorganisation e.V. (PNO), see: <http://www.profibus.com>

All the PROFINET protocols are based on standard [Ethernet](/Ethernet).

There are two PROFINET "flavours" available, IO and CBA (which are independent of each other) and some related "helper" protocols.

## Protocols

  - [PROFINET/CBA](/PROFINET/CBA): distributed automation.

  - [PROFINET/DCP](/PROFINET/DCP): discovery and basic configuration.

  - [PROFINET/IO](/PROFINET/IO): decentralized periphery.

  - [PROFINET/MRP](/PROFINET/MRP): media redundancy protocol.

  - [PROFINET/MRRT](/PROFINET/MRRT): media redundancy for [PROFINET/RT](/PROFINET/RT).

  - [PROFINET/PTCP](/PROFINET/PTCP): precision time control protocol.

  - [PROFINET/RT](/PROFINET/RT): real time data transfer.

  - [PROFINET/IRT](/PROFINET/IRT) : isochronous real time data transfer
