Every once in a while, an antivirus program pops up and says that Wireshark (and Ethereal before it) contains some sort of malware. This is a list of the reports we've received in reverse chronological order. So far, every single report has been a false positive.

The Wireshark Windows installer uses NSIS, who maintain [their own list](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSIS_False_Positives).

A couple of Wireshark University training DVDs contain [trace files with virus signatures](http://ask.wireshark.org/questions/147/w32spybotatew-on-disks-2-and-4-of-wsu). These pose no risk but can trigger false alarms.
