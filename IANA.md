# Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

The [IANA](http://www.iana.org) assigns a lot of different numbers (and the like) related to network protocols. Widely known are the well known [TCP](/TCP)/[UDP](/UDP) port assignments (see [PortReference](/PortReference)), such as the assignment of [TCP](/TCP) port 80 as the standard port for [HTTP](/HTTP) traffic. In addition to this, the IANA has made a number of other assignments:

  - [Protocol numbers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers) for protocols running on top of [IP](/IP)

  - [Media types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html) used in [HTTP](/HTTP), [SIP](/SIP), e-mail, [WSP](/WSP), [MMSE](/MMSE) and many other protocols

## History

The assigned numbers (including the port numbers) were once reported using [RFC](/RFC) documents. Several of such obsoleted RFCs exists (1700, 1340, 1060, 1010, 990, 960, 943, 923, 900, 870, 820, 790, 776, 770, 762, 758,755, 750, 739, 604, 503, 433, 349). Today, the IANA keeps "living documents" of assigned numbers on their webpage.
