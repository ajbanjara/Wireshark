# Yellow Pages Passwd (YPPASSWD)

XXX - add a brief YPPASSWD description here

## History

XXX - add a brief description of YPPASSWD history

## Protocol dependencies

  - [ONC-RPC](/ONC-RPC): Typically, YPPASSWD uses [ONC-RCP](/ONC-RCP) as its transport protocol.

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example traffic here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The YPPASSWD dissector is (fully functional, partially functional, not existing, ... whatever the current state is). Also add info of additional Wireshark features where appropriate, like special statistics of this protocol.

## Preference Settings

(XXX add links to preference settings affecting how YPPASSWD is dissected).

## Example capture file

XXX - Add a simple example capture file to the [SampleCaptures](/SampleCaptures) page and link from here (see below). Keep this file short, it's also a good idea to gzip it to make it even smaller, as Wireshark can open gzipped files automatically.

  - [SampleCaptures/PROTO.pcap](uploads/__moin_import__/attachments/SampleCaptures/PROTO.pcap)

## Display Filter

A complete list of YPPASSWD display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/y/yppasswd.html)

Show only the YPPASSWD based traffic:

``` 
 yppasswd 
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter YPPASSWD protocols while capturing.

## External links

  - add link to YPPASSWD specification and where to find additional info on the web about it, e.g.:

  - [RFC 123](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc123.txt) *The RFC title* - explanation of the RFC content.
