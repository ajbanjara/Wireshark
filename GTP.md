# GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP)

Used on:

  - the Gn and Gp interfaces of the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS);
  - the Iu, Gn and Gp interfaces of the UMTS system.

Specified in 3GPP TS 29.060

## History

XXX - add a brief description of PROTO history

## Protocol dependencies

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example decoded traffic for this protocol here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The GTP dissector is fully functional.

## Preference Settings

(XXX add links to preference settings affecting how PROTO is dissected).

## Example capture file

XXX - Add a simple example capture file to the [SampleCaptures](/SampleCaptures) page and link from here (see below). Keep this file short, it's also a good idea to gzip it to make it even smaller, as Wireshark can open gzipped files automatically.

## Display Filter

A complete list of PROTO display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/protofirstletter/proto.html)

Show only the GTP based traffic:

``` 
 GTP 
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter GTP protocols while capturing.
