# Tap Reference

Unlike [switches](/SwitchReference) and [hubs](/HubReference), network taps operate independently of your network hardware. Many models have a number of advantages including performance, filtering, timestamping, manageability, and visibility but they also add expense and typically require rack space and power. For complete discussions of port mirroring vs taps, see the blog articles by [Tim O'Neil](http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/08/span-ports-or-t.html) and [Richard Bejtlich](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2009/01/why-network-taps.html).
