# Name Binding Protocol (NBP)

XXX - add a brief NBP description here

## History

XXX - add a brief description of NBP history

## Protocol dependencies

  - [DDP](/DDP): Typically, NBP uses [DDP](/DDP) as its transport protocol.

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example traffic here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The NBP dissector is (fully functional, partially functional, not existing, ... whatever the current state is). Also add info of additional Wireshark features where appropriate, like special statistics of this protocol.

## Preference Settings

(XXX add links to preference settings affecting how NBP is dissected).

## Example capture file

XXX - Add a simple example capture file to the [SampleCaptures](/SampleCaptures) page and link from here. Keep it short, it's also a good idea to gzip it to make it even smaller, as Wireshark can open gzipped files automatically.

## Display Filter

A complete list of NBP display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/n/nbp.html)

Show only the NBP based traffic:

``` 
 nbp 
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter NBP protocols while capturing.

## External links

  - add link to NBP specification and where to find additional info on the web about NBP
