# X2 Application Protocol (X2AP)

Access Network (E-UTRAN); X2 Application Protocol (X2AP)

## History

## Protocol dependencies

  - [SCTP](/SCTP): Typically, X2AP uses [SCTP](/SCTP) as its transport protocol. The the PPID for X2AP traffic is 27.

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example decoded traffic for this protocol here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The X2AP dissector is automatically generated from ASN1 descriptions by [Asn2wrs](/Asn2wrs) and is fully functional.

## Preference Settings

## Example capture file

XXX - Add a simple example capture file to the [SampleCaptures](/SampleCaptures) page and link from here (see below). Keep this file short, it's also a good idea to gzip it to make it even smaller, as Wireshark can open gzipped files automatically.

## Display Filter

A complete list of PROTO display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/protofirstletter/proto.html)

Show only the X2AP based traffic:
