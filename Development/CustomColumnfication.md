# Custom column migration

This wiki page describes the ongoing transition from using predefined columns to custom columns (aka. custom columnfication). The reason for this is that custom columns are a superset of predefined columns. Eliminating the predefined columns will streamline both the UI and the codebase.

This custom columnfication project was suggested 2009-Aug-15 on the wireshark-dev list:

  - [\[Wireshark-dev\] Reduce the number of "fixed columns"?](http://www.wireshark.org/lists/wireshark-dev/200908/msg00140.html)

## Candidates for removal/migration

TBD

## Removed/migrated

None yet.
