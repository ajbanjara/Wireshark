I'm a Samba developer and occasional wireshark contributor. So far my contributions have been to the AIM, DCOM, [BitTorrent](/BitTorrent) and DCE/RPC dissectors.

My personal homepage is at <http://samba.org/~jelmer/>. I can be reached by email at <jelmer@samba.org>

One of the things I'm currently working on is generating DCE/RPC dissectors using Samba4's IDL compiler (together with [RonnieSahlberg](/RonnieSahlberg) and [TimPotter](/TimPotter)).
