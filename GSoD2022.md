# Ideas

1. Update screenshots from GTK UI to QT UI. Document (in comments) which version of Wireshark and which PCAP was used to create the screenshot. PCAPs should be available from the Wireshark Wiki or bug tracker.

2. Remediate the known documentation issues in Bugzilla:
* https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/17338
* https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/17105
* https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/16982
* https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/12336

## Others

The above list of projects are suggested examples. Feel free to propose your own idea on the [wireshark-dev mailing list](https://www.wireshark.org/lists/wireshark-dev/).

# Proposal
## Project proposal title
Update Wireshark User Guide screenshots

## About your organization
Wireshark is the world's foremost network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what's happening on your network at a microscopic level. It is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many industries and educational institutions.

Wireshark development thrives thanks to the contributions of networking experts across the globe. It is the continuation of a project that started in 1998.

## About your project
Many of the screenshots in the Wireshark user guide are significantly out of date. This is exacerbated when the GUI was migrated from Gtk to Qt, but not all screenshots were updated. This makes it harder for users to follow the examples in the documentation, causing a much poorer user experience.

We'd like a technical writer to update the screenshots in the Wireshark User Guide and the documentation surrounding those screenshots so that the user guide is fully up to date and an accurate reference for users.

The project itself will take approximately six months to complete. The first month will be focused on how to build Wireshark, generate the user guides, and submit pull requests on Gitlab. The remaining months will be focused on updating the screenshots and associated documentation. Note that although there are approximately 140 screenshots, not all will need to be updated.

## Budget
Technical writer updating Wireshark user guide: $6,000
Project T-shirts (10): $300

Total: $6,300

## Additional information

Wireshark previously participated in GSoD 2020 (https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2020/participants/project-wireshark-alexnik) with great success. The planned Wireshark mentor for 2022 is not the same as 2020, but directly assisted the technical writer when she had questions.

# The result
