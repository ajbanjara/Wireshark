# American National Standards Institute (ANSI)

To quote [the "About ANSI" page](http://www.ansi.org/about_ansi/overview/overview.aspx) on [the ANSI Web site](http://www.ansi.org/): "The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a private, non-profit organization (501(c)3) that administers and coordinates the U.S. voluntary standardization and conformity assessment system."

The ["Introduction" page](http://www.ansi.org/about_ansi/introduction/introduction.aspx) on that site explains in more detail:

ANSI facilitates the development of American National Standards (ANS) by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations (SDOs). These groups work cooperatively to develop voluntary national consensus standards. Accreditation by ANSI signifies that the procedures used by the standards body in connection with the development of American National Standards meet the Instituteâ€™s essential requirements for openness, balance, consensus and due process.

I.e., ANSI do not themselves create standards; ANSI standards are developed by organizations accredited by ANSI.

The accredited standards development organization for information technology is [INCITS](http://www.incits.org/), the InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards, formerly known as NCITS, the National Committee for Information Technology Standards, and, prior to that, it was the X3 committee of ANSI.

They develop a wide range of information technology-related standards, including standards for programming languages such as C and for device-to-host interconnects such as [SCSI](/SCSI), [FibreChannel](/FibreChannel), and ATA, but they also have some network protocol related standards, such as the [FiberDistributedDataInterface](/FiberDistributedDataInterface) (FDDI).
