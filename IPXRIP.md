# IPX Routing Information Protocol (IPXRIP)

See the [IPX](/IPX) page for further information. Member of the [NovellProtocolFamily](/NovellProtocolFamily).

XXX - add a brief IPXRIP description here

## History

XXX - add a brief description of IPXRIP history

## Protocol dependencies

  - [IPX](/IPX): Typically, IPXRIP uses [IPX](/IPX) as its transport protocol.

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example traffic here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The IPXRIP dissector is (fully functional, partially functional, not existing, ... whatever the current state is). Also add info of additional Wireshark features where appropriate, like special statistics of this protocol.

## Preference Settings

(XXX add links to preference settings affecting how IPXRIP is dissected).

## Example capture file

XXX - Add a simple example capture file to the [SampleCaptures](/SampleCaptures) page and link from here. Keep it short, it's also a good idea to gzip it to make it even smaller, as Wireshark can open gzipped files automatically.

## Display Filter

A complete list of IPXRIP display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/i/ipxrip.html)

Show only the IPXRIP based traffic:

``` 
 ipxrip 
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter IPXRIP protocols while capturing.

IPX Router specification, Chapter 3, "Routing Information Protocol (RIP)" <http://developer.novell.com/devres/langrp/specs.htm> *rpspspec.exe is an executable .zip file, meaning it can be unzipped on non-MS-DOS OSes; the .PRN files are postscript files which can be convered to PDF via the ghostscript ps2pdf utility*
