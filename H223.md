# ITU H.223

H.223 is a multiplexing and framing protocol for multimedia streams over fixed-rate channels. It is used by video phones to send their data over the PSTN.

## History

H.223 was developed by the [ITU-T](/ITU-T).

## Protocol dependencies

  - Typically, H.223 is the lowest software layer, so depends only on hardware.

  - However, Wireshark only dissects H.223 when it is transferred over [TCP](/TCP), [IAX2](/IAX2), or [RTP](/RTP).

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example traffic here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The H.223 dissector is partially functional. It currently only dissects H.223 Level 2. Its handling of complex multiplex tables is untested.

## Preference Settings

There are no configurable preferences for H.223

## Display Filter

A complete list of H.223 display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/h/h223.html)

Show only the H.223 based traffic:

``` 
 h223 
```

Since post 0.10.12 Wireshark only\!

## Capture Filter

You cannot filter H.223 while capturing.
