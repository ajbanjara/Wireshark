# ITU H.323

H.323 "Packet-based multimedia communications systems" refers to a family of VoIP protocols including [H225](/H225) and [H245](/H245), see [VOIPProtocolFamily](/VOIPProtocolFamily) for an overview.

## History

H.323 was introduced by the [ITU-T](/ITU-T) in 1996.

## Protocol dependencies

  - H.323 is independent of the underlying transport protocol, but uses [H225](/H225) and [H245](/H245)

## Example traffic

## Wireshark

The H.323 dissector is (fully functional, partially functional, not existing, ... whatever the current state is). Since Wireshark 0.10.7, a list of H.323 conversations was added, see Statistics-\>H.323 Conversations...

## Example capture file

  - [SampleCaptures/rtp\_example.raw.gz](uploads/__moin_import__/attachments/SampleCaptures/rtp_example.raw.gz) example H245 capture file including [H225](/H225), [H245](/H245), [RTP](/RTP) and [RTCP](/RTCP) packets

## Display Filter

As H.323 isn't a protocol itself, you cannot filter on it. But you can filter on [H245](/H245) and [H225](/H225).

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter H.323 protocols while capturing.
