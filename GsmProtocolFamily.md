# Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) protocol family

GSM is a technology for digital wireless telecommunications, represented by a decent number of specifications. Parts of GSM are based on the fixed-line [ISDN](/ISDN) technology.

The original "air interface" for GSM handsets, for second-generation (2G) wireless telephony, was a TDMA interface; the third-generation interface, W-CDMA, is a CDMA interface. GSM, however, refers to more than just the "air interface"; it refers to the complete set of protocols.

The 3rd Generation Partnership Project ([3GPP](/3GPP)) maintains the GSM standards; most of the specifications for GSM can now be found at [the 3GPP Web site](http://www.3gpp.org/).

## History

Incidentally, the initial abbreviation of GSM was "Groupe Sp√©cial Mobile" (Special Mobile Group). The acronym was preserved but a new, English meaning was given to it later, once the potential of the technology was understood.

## Protocols

The GSM protocol family consists of many protocols, and other protocols are conveyed on top of these.

  - [GSMMAP](/GSMMAP): GSM Mobile Application Part, [ETSI](/ETSI) TS 129 002

  - [GSM SMS](/GSM-SMS): The GSM Short Messaging Service.

  - [CAMEL](/CAMEL): Customized Applications for Mobile Enhanced Logic ETSI 300 374

  - [GSM A](/GSM-A): GSM A Interface (BSSMAP/DTAP)

  - [WapProtocolFamily](/WapProtocolFamily): The entire collection of [WAP](/WAP) protocols can be conveyed over GSM.

## Network Elements and Interfaces

### Network and Switching Subsystem

#### Circuit Switching Control Nodes ("Core Circuit")

##### MSC Mobile Switching Center

Controls Mobile Calls. Is in charge of the radio part. In Release 4 of UMTS, this function is split between a Media Gateway (MGw), which handles the bearer (user) traffic (voice, video, etc.) and an MSC Server, which handles the call control. In GSM and earlier releases of UMTS, the base stations communicate with the MSC, which handles both bearer traffic and call control. A Gateway MSC, or Gw MSC (or GMSC) connects to other networks, such as the PSTN or other mobile networks.

##### TSC Transit Switching Center

Transit Exchange for calls to be routed either between MSCs or towards other networks.

#### Registers

##### VLR Visitor Location Registry

Keeps track of the users of the network both resident and in roaming

##### HLR Home Location Registry

Keeps track of (a part of) the subscribers of the network and how they can use it. Each user is identified by the IMSI, a 15 digit number (Not the one printed in the SIM that is the ICCID); the first three digits are the country identifier (eg. 222 is Italy), the following two digits are the network (in Italy 01 is TIM, 02 is Vodafone), and the rest is the unique number of the SIM. The HLR contains such data as the current roaming, redirection, and special services settings.

##### EIR Equipment Information Registry

Keeps track of Mobile Phones; it could be used to find stolen equipment if operators were forced to use it (they make plenty of money out of calls made from stolen phones so they won't do it unless forced).

##### AuC Authentication Centre

Maintains information regarding the cryptographic keys that are in the SIM (Subscriber Information Module). It authenticates the user in the network.

##### FNR Flexible Number Registry

Keeps a Database of Numbers owned and exported by the network (Number Portability).

### GSM Radio Access Network (GERAN)

#### BSC Base Station Controller

Maintains and controls the radio part of the network.

#### BTS Base Tranceiver Station

The machine with the antennae. A slave of the BSC from which it takes its configuration.

#### MS Mobile Set

The phone or modem. "PC" refers to a personal computer with the MS as a modem.

### UMTS Radio Access Network (UTRAN)

#### RNC Radio Network Controller

Like the BSC but for UMTS.

#### Node-B (RBS) Radio Base Station

Like the BTS but for UMTS.

#### UE User Equipment

The phone or modem. "PC" refers to a personal computer with the UE as a modem.

A gateway between the SGSNs and the other networks

  - Should the "GSM" page be a page for the GSM Association, as the 3GPP page is a page for the Third Generation Partnership Project? -*Guy Harris*
