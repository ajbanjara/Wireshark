# STANAG 4406 Military Messaging (s4406)

The STANAG 4406 Military Messaging is similar to the IPM Service defined in the civilian standards, [X420](/X420). It includes extensions for services required in the military environment. These extensions are defined using the standard extension mechanism defined in X.420.

STANAG 4406 defines a new extended content type known as "P772" - [1.3.26.0.4406.0.4.1](http://oid.elibel.tm.fr/1.3.26.0.4406.0.4.1).

STANAG 4406 also utilises the Cryptographic Message Syntax [CMS](/CMS) and the Enhanced Security Service [ESS](/ESS) to define the Protecting Content Type ([1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.6](http://oid.elibel.tm.fr/1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.6)) support secure military messaging.

## History

STANAG 4406 has gone through a number of versions but the current ratified version is Edition 1 (previously known as version 3).

## Protocol dependencies

  - [X411](/X411): Typically, S4406 uses [X411](/X411) as its transport protocol.

  - [X420](/X420): S4406 uses the base definition [X420](/X420) and its extension mechanisms

  - [CMS](/CMS) and [ESS](/ESS): S4406 uses [CMS](/CMS) and [ESS](/ESS) to sign and label a military message.

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example traffic here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The S4406 dissector is fully functional, though some features may not yet have been implemented in the [X420](/X420) dissector.

## Preference Settings

There are no preference settings specific to X420 but you might want to enable reassembly of those transport protocols that are used below X420. Specifically, COTP reassembly.

## Example capture file

## Display Filter

A complete list of S4406 display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/s/s4406.html)

Show only the S4406 based traffic:

``` 
 s4406
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter S4406 protocols while capturing. However, if you know the [TCP](/TCP) port used (see above), you can filter on that one.

Capture only the S4406 traffic over the default port (102):

``` 
 tcp port 102 
```
