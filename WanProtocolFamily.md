# WAN Protocol Family

A variety of different protocols are used on "wide-area networks" or WANs. At the physical layer, a line carrying a T1/E1/J1 signal or higher-speed T-carrier or E-carrier lines, or a fraction thereof, or a SONET/SDH optical link, or fraction thereof, could be used. Alternatively, a connection to a switched network, such as an [X.25](/X.25), [FrameRelay](/FrameRelay), or [ATM](/ATM) network might be used, with a line or optical connection such as the ones listed being used for that connection.

On top of that physical layer one might, for example, run [PPP](/PPP) or [Cisco HDLC](/Cisco-HDLC), inside some HDLC-like framing.

10-gigabit Ethernet was intended to be used not only as a LAN or MAN protocol, but also as a WAN protocol.

## History

XXX - add a brief description of the history of the protocol family

## Protocols

  - [FrameRelay](/FrameRelay)

  - [ATM](/ATM)

  - [X.25](/X.25)

  - [PPP](/PPP): The Point-to-Point protocol

  - [Cisco HDLC](/Cisco-HDLC): Cisco's proprietary (but public) encapsulation protocol

## External links

  - add links to pages and sites with information about that protocol family, such as an organization responsible for defining and maintaining the protocol family
