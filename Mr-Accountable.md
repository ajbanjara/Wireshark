### Diary

7/15 Installed and used Sharkwire.

  - "Chinese government" style packets, I can read some Chinese, perhaps these are seen as "Chinese government activities" because provincial governments operate ISPs. Duh.
  - KPO Activity
  - Expert info: No Warnings or errors
  - Sharkwire is great\!

7/16

  - Some "Chinese government" type packets, seemingly unrelated to watching the footie on Chinese tv.

  - A long series of numerically ascending packets from Europe ie 91.xx.xx.xx, 92.xx.xx.xx, 93.xx.xx.xx, one every minute, creating very many Expert info --\> Errors.

7/17

  - @ 0830 US Eastern Time logged onto an Asian sports programming provider, immediate plateau in non-video activity definitely related to just logging into the broadcast, including 6 Errors of Malformed packets, and 3 Warnings, from Expert info in @5 min of being logged in. I then logged off the internet tv.

\* Many packets originating from Asia Pacific Network Information Centre in AU, whose purview includes Greater Oceania.
