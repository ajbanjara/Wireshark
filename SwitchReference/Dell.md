PowerConnect 3324 and 3348: see the [“Port Monitor Commands” page](http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/network/pc33xx/en/CLI/J0926a00/portmoni.htm#1017474) of the [Dell™ PowerConnect™ 3324/3348 Switch CLI Guide](http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/network/pc33xx/en/CLI/J0926a00/). Note the restrictions on the destination port (the port to which switch traffic will be sent, and into which you'll plug the interface on which you'll capture traffic) and the source ports (ports that are to be monitored).

There is a post on the [Dell support site](http://support.dell.com/) that contains some useful [information about configuration and limitations](http://forums.us.dell.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=pc_managed&message.id=1425).

[Further information about individual switch models](http://support.dell.com/support/systemsinfo/documentation.aspx?l=en&~cat=4&~subcat=106) is available; it's left as an exercise to the reader to put in more links for other Dell switch models — Wikis are maintained by their users, after all…

\*Dell 5324 GEC Bonding — Switch does not appear to forward IP datagrams larger than 49,000 bytes.
