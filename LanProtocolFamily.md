# LAN/MAN Protocol Family

The [IEEE](/IEEE) have produced and are producing a set of standards for link-layer and supporting protocols for Local Area Networks (LANs) and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs); these protocols are referred to as the IEEE 802.x protocols, ad they have protocol numbers that begin with "802." followed by a number and possibly one or more letters after the number. Many of those standards are available from [the Get IEEE 802 site](http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/index.html).

In addition, the [FiberDistributedDataInterface](/FiberDistributedDataInterface) or [FDDI](/FDDI) has also been used for LANs, although the FDDI standard came from [ANSI](/ANSI), not the IEEE.

## Protocols

The LAN/MAN family consists of (at least) the following protocols and sets of protocols (some link layers might have some additional protocols):

Link layer:

  - [Ethernet](/Ethernet): IEEE 802.3 Ethernet

  - [FiberDistributedDataInterface](/FiberDistributedDataInterface): FDDI

  - [TokenRing](/TokenRing): IEEE 802.5 Token Ring

  - [IEEE\_802.11](/IEEE_802.11): IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs

It also includes:

  - [LLC](/LLC): IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control (also an [ISO](/ISO) protocol standard, ISO 8802-2)

  - [STP](/STP): IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol

  - [GARP](/GARP): Generic Attribute Registration Protocol

  - [GMRP](/GMRP): GARP Multicast Registration Protocol

  - [MMRP](/MMRP): Multiple MAC Registration Protocol (replacing previous protocol [GMRP](/GMRP))

  - IEEE 802.1H Bridging of Ethernet V2.0 frames on non-Ethernet LANs/MANs

  - IEEE 802.1w Rapid Reconfiguration for bridges

  - [VLAN](/VLAN): IEEE 802.1Q Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks

  - [GVRP](/GVRP): GARP VLAN Registration Protocol

  - [MVRP](/MVRP): Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (replacing previous protocol [GVRP](/GVRP))

  - IEEE 802.1X Port-Based Network Access Control

  - [TTEthernet](/TTEthernet): Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTE)
