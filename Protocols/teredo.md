"Teredo is an IPv6 transition technology that provides address assignment and host-to-host automatic tunneling for unicast IPv6 traffic when IPv6/IPv4 hosts are located behind one or multiple IPv4 network address translators (NATs). To traverse IPv4 NATs, IPv6 packets are sent as IPv4-based User Datagram Protocol (UDP) messages. This article provides an overview of Teredo—including Teredo addresses and packet structures—and detailed explanations of how communication is initiated between Teredo clients, Teredo host-specific relays, and IPv6-only hosts using the IPv4 Internet, the IPv6 Internet, Teredo servers, and Teredo relays."
