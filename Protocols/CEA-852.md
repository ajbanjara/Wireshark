# Component Network over IP (CN/IP)

CN/IP is defined in standard EIA/CEA-852. It is used to transport component network frames such as LON over UDP or TCP.

A word of warning: The CN/IP dissector was implemented in order to dissect [LON](/Protocols/CEA-709.1) traffic. The dissector was not tested with real CN/IP traffic, but with packets I generated myself.

## History

## Protocol dependencies

  - [UDP](/UDP): Typically, CN/IP uses [UDP](/UDP) as its transport protocol. The well known port for CN/IP traffic is 1628.

  - [TCP](/TCP): CN/IP can also use [TCP](/TCP) as its transport protocol. The port number is the same.

## Example traffic

    Frame 10611: 70 bytes on wire (560 bits), 70 bytes captured (560 bits)
    Ethernet II, Src: 00:00:00:00:00:00 (00:00:00:00:00:00), Dst: 00:00:00:00:00:00 (00:00:00:00:00:00)
    Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1), Dst: 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1)
    User Datagram Protocol, Src Port: 43769 (43769), Dst Port: 1628 (1628)

## Wireshark

The CN/IP dissector currently only supports dissection of data frames.

## Preference Settings

No preference setting at this time.

## Example capture file

  - [SampleCaptures/eia709.1-over-eia852.pcap](uploads/__moin_import__/attachments/SampleCaptures/eia709.1-over-eia852.pcap)

## Display Filter

A complete list of display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/protofirstletter/proto.html)

Show only the CN/IP based traffic:

``` 
 cnip 
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter CN/IP protocols while capturing. However, if you know the [UDP](/UDP) port used (see above), you can filter on that one.

Capture only the CN/IP traffic over the default port (1628):

``` 
 udp port 1628 
```
