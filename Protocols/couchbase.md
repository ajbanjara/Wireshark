The protocol for Couchbase Server is primarily an extension of memcached binary protocol, authored by the people who originally designed the memcached protocol for the memcached project. The Couchbase protocol adds several things that are used in conjunction with the Couchbase bucket type/storage engine behind Couchbase Server.

Experimental support is currently available on Sergey Avseyev's [branch](https://github.com/avsej/wireshark/compare/master...couchbase-dissector). It will be submitted upstream after a few last niggling issues are resolved.
