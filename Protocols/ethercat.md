# EtherCAT

EtherCAT is an open, high performance Ethernet-based fieldbus system. The development goal of EtherCAT was to apply Ethernet to automation applications which require short data update times (also called cycle times) with low communication jitter (for synchronization purposes) and low hardware costs. The EtherCAT protocol is optimised for process data and is transported directly within the standard IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame using Ethertype 0x88a4. It may consist of several sub-datagrams, each serving a particular memory area of the logical process images that can be up to 4 gigabytes in size. The data sequence is independent of the physical order of the nodes in the network; addressing can be in any order. Broadcast, multicast and communication between slaves are possible. If IP routing is required, the EtherCAT protocol can be inserted into UDP/IP or TCP/IP datagrams. This also enables any control with Ethernet protocol stack to address EtherCAT systems.

## History

## Protocol dependencies

  - [Ethernet](/Ethernet): EtherCAT can use [Ethernet](/Ethernet) as its transport mechanism. The assigned Ethernet type for EtherCAT traffic is 0x88A4.

  - [UDP](/UDP): EtherCAT protocol can be transported in [UDP](/UDP) datagrams. The assigned UDP port for EtherCAT is 0x88a4.

## Wireshark

## Preference Settings

There are no EtherCAT specific preference settings. Allowing sub dissectors to handle data based on heuristic analysis is always enabled and cannot be turned off.

## Sub dissectors

Dissectors that are interested in dissecting the EtherCAT datagram portion of the EtherCAT frame (there may be multiple EtherCAT datagrams in each frame), may do so using heuristic analysis by registering themselves using the function *heur\_dissector\_add("ecat.data", ...).*

## Display Filter

A complete list of IP display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/e/ethercat.html)

Show only the EtherCAT based traffic:

``` 
 ecat
```

Filter on a specific address offset (ado):

``` 
 ecat.ado == 0x130
```

Filter on a specific slave by its position or fixed EtherCAT address (adp):

``` 
 ecat.adp == 0x3e9
```

Filter on a specific cmd (here APRD):

``` 
 ecat.cmd == 0x1
```

Filter on a specific field of a sub command :

``` 
 ecat.sub1.idx < 0x80
```

Show only the EtherCAT mailbox traffic:

``` 
 ecat_mailbox
```

## Capture Filter

Capture Ethercat-over-Ethernet traffic only:

``` 
 ether proto 0x88a4 
```

Capture Ethercat-over-UDP traffic only:

``` 
 udp port 0x88a4 
```
