# LonTalk (LON)

Apart from building control [LonTalk](/LonTalk) is used in industry automation, at railway stations, for on-train telemetry, in traffic management, and smart meters.

## History

The [LonTalk](/LonTalk) protocol was originally developed by Echelon Inc. in 1988. In 1999 it was approved as ANSI standard EIA/CEA-709.1.

## Protocol dependencies

  - [CNIP](/CNIP): [LonTalk](/LonTalk) can be transmitted over a variety of media, but Wireshark can only capture LON traffic when it is encapsulated in [UDP](/UDP) or [TCP](/TCP) packets. [CNIP](/CN/IP) is the encapsulation protocol used for [LonTalk](/LonTalk).

## Example traffic

    Frame 3057: 74 bytes on wire (592 bits), 74 bytes captured (592 bits)

## Wireshark

The LON dissector decodes all types of LON packets. Multicast traffic is not well tested and statistics collection as well as conversation tracking is missing.

## Preference Settings

Preferences are not implemented in the [LonTalk](/LonTalk) dissector.

## Example capture file

  - [SampleCaptures/eia709.1-over-eia852.pcap](uploads/__moin_import__/attachments/SampleCaptures/eia709.1-over-eia852.pcap)

## Display Filter

Show only the LON based traffic:

``` 
 lon 
```

Only display Network variables with ID 0x375:

    lon.nv == 0x375

## Capture Filter

[LonTalk](/LonTalk) can only be captured as part of a [CN/IP](/Protocols/CEA-852) packet.
