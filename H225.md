# ITU H.225

H.225 "Call signalling protocols and media stream packetization for packet-based multimedia communication systems" is a VoIP protocol, see [VOIPProtocolFamily](/VOIPProtocolFamily) for an overview.

## History

H.225 was introduced by the [ITU-T](/ITU-T) in 1996?

## Protocol dependencies

  - H.225 is independent of the underlying transport protocol

## Example traffic

XXX - Add example traffic here (as plain text or Wireshark screenshot).

## Wireshark

The H.225 dissector is (fully functional, partially functional, not existing, ... whatever the current state is). Message and Message Reason Counters are available, see Statistics-\>H.225...

## Preference Settings

One preference setting exists: Whether to do "reassembly h225 spanning multiple TCP segments or not" this setting is dependent on settings in [TCP](/TCP), [Q.931](/Q.931) and [TPKT](/TPKT).

## Example capture file

[SampleCaptures/rtp\_example.raw.gz](uploads/__moin_import__/attachments/SampleCaptures/rtp_example.raw.gz) (libpcap) A VoIP sample capture of a [H323](/H323) call (including [H225](/H225), [H245](/H245), [RTP](/RTP) and [RTCP](/RTCP)).

## Display Filter

A complete list of H.225 display filter fields can be found in the [display filter reference](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/h/h225.html)

Show only the H.225 based traffic:

``` 
 h225 
```

## Capture Filter

You cannot directly filter H.225 protocols while capturing.
