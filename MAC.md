# Medium Access Protocol (MAC)

This protocol is the layer 2 protocol of the UTRAN Iub interface between a Node-B and an RNC. For instance, it maps logical channels (BCCH, PCCH, DCCH, ...) to transport channels (PCH, FACH, RACH, ...). The protocol and its functions are specified in [3GPP TS 25.321](http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/25321.htm).

## Protocol dependencies

  - MAC runs over FP (Frame Protocol), both for Control and for Data connections
  - MAC calls the RLC (Radio Link Control) protocol for further dissection

## Example traffic

At the moment, no example traffic is available

## Wireshark

The MAC dissector is partially functional (it only supports FDD, not TDD mode). Dissection is possible for RACH, FACH, PCH, DCH, E-DCH and HSDSCH.

To correctly dissect frames, the MAC dissector requires per-frame information on whether or not a C/T MUX field is present and what kind of content the frame contains. At the moment, this information can be generated by using the [FP Hint](/FP-Hint) protocol.
